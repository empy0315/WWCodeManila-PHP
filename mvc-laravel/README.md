# MVC with Laravel


This is a Laravel dockerized ver [5.6](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/archive/v5.6.0.zip) 


### Getting Started

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/) installed.

Open the docker terminal and raise up the needed containers. Make sure you are inside this <b>mvc-laravel</b> folder.

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

If you invoke
```sh
$ docker ps -a
```

You should be able to see something similar to this
```sh
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                           NAMES

```
Install vendor dependencies

```sh
docker exec wwcodelaravel_app_1 php composer.phar install
```
On your browser go to
```sh

You should be able to see the default Laravel landing page. :)

Happy Coding! :)
